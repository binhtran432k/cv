## What kind of business domain have you used/experienced/been strong at?

I have extensive experience in frontend development, gained from writing blogger templates prior to university. This gave me a solid foundation in web development principles and practices. I then joined FPT Software during my university years to learn backend development skills in Java. After realizing that the web development process encompasses more than just frontend and backend development, I participated in a training program at NashTech to learn about automation testing in Dotnet and Python. I am now confident in my ability to work as a fullstack web developer, and I am eager to learn new things every day.

## Expected Onboarding Date

I can start working immediately, or at least I have just self-studied a fundamental Go programming concept. For example, I can now explain the difference between a struct and a class in Go, or I can write a simple program to print "Hello, world!" to the console.

## Did the candidate have experience with Product company/Startup environment in the past?

I do not have direct product company/startup experience, but I am a quick learner, able to work independently, and passionate about technology. I am confident I can contribute to the team's success.
